=> List Interface - is a data structure in which we can store
the ordered collection
 of objects. It can have duplicate values.
List interface is implemented by the classes:  ArrayList, LinkedList,
(Vector, and Stack).

========================================================================
List in Java provides the facility to maintain the ordered collection.
It contains the index-based methods to insert, update,
delete and search the elements. It can have the duplicate elements also.
We can also store the null elements in the list.
The List interface is found in the java.util
package and inherits the Collection interface.

#####_____ ArrayList _____#####
The ArrayList class implements the List interface.
It uses a dynamic array to store the duplicate element of different data types.
The ArrayList class maintains the insertion order and is non-synchronized.
The elements stored in the ArrayList class can be randomly accessed.

#####_____ LinkedList _____#####
LinkedList implements the Collection interface.
It uses a doubly linked list internally to store the elements.
It can store the duplicate elements.
It maintains the insertion order and is not synchronized.
In LinkedList, the manipulation is fast because no shifting is required.

#### ArrayList vs LinkedList #####
===>  Common :
    ArrayList and LinkedList both implements
        List interface and maintains insertion order.
        Both are non synchronized classes.

===>  Difference:
// 1.
    ArrayList uses a dynamic array to store the elements.
    LinkedList uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
// 2.
    ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.
    LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
